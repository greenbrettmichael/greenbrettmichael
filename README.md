> I am very curiosity driven. I took my studies in physics to learn more about the world, and then found that simulation is very helpful when you want to get answers. I started my programming journey writing high-performance code for GPU to replace logic using older, slower CPU cluster HPC algorithms at FSU. It was very satisfying to optimize performance against a slow, expensive operation and seeing the same task take seconds on a laptop. In my professional career, I applied my studies to building interactive 3D environments from CAD and lidar as well as implementing realtime physical simulations for water, fire, smoke, and complex system operations. I have also built a few simple storefronts and back-office systems, including one being used at scale for enterprise users replacing a manual quoting system. My current focus is creating digital models, suitable for inspection and reverse engineering, from images.
